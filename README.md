# CityGML-schema-validation

Small script to validate a CityGML file against the XSD schemas of CityGML. All the schemas of CityGML (v0.4, v1.0 and v2.0) are included.

To use:

`$ ./valxsdcitygml.py input.gml`

or you can also give a folder and all XML and GML files in that folder (and in all the folders inside that one)

`$ ./valxsdcitygml.py /home/elvis/data/`
